# Cryptography Coding Challenge Solution

This repository contains Python code for solving various cryptography challenges. It includes implementations of the Caesar Cipher and Vigenère Cipher algorithms.

## Introduction

This code solves cryptography challenges using Python. It demonstrates the encoding and decoding of messages using different algorithms.

## Features

- Decode Vishal's Message: Decodes a message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Send Vishal a Coded Message: Encodes a message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Decoding and Coding Functions: Separate functions for decoding and coding messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Solving a Caesar Cipher without Knowing the Shift Value: Demonstrates how to find the correct decoding when the shift value is unknown.
- The Vigenère Cipher: Implements the Vigenère Cipher algorithm for encoding and decoding messages using a given keyword.

## Usage

To explore the functionality of the code, run the provided examples in your Python environment. Feel free to modify the code, input different messages, and test with your own scenarios.
